                    [Phoebe discovered spinning.

           <h5>No. 1. When maiden loves, she sits and sighs
                      (INTRODUCTION and SONG)
                               Phoebe
           </h5>
  PHOEBE              When maiden loves, she sits and sighs,
                           She wanders to and fro;
                      Unbidden tear-drops fill her eyes,
                      And to all questions she replies,
                           With a sad "Heigh-ho!"

                      'Tis but a little word—"Heigh-ho!"
                      So soft, 'tis scarcely heard—"Heigh-ho!"
                           An idle breath—
                           Yet life and death
                      May hang upon a maid's "Heigh-ho!"

                      When maiden loves, she mopes apart,
                           As owl mopes on a tree;
                      Although she keenly feels the smart,
                      She cannot tell what ails her heart,
                           With its sad "Ah, me!"

                      'Tis but a foolish sigh—"Ah, me!"
                      Born but to droop and die—"Ah, me!"
                           Yet all the sense
                           Of eloquence
                      Lies hidden in a maid's "Ah, me!"

                           Yet all the sense
                           Of eloquence
                      Lies hidden in a maid's "Ah, me!"
                           "Ah, me!", "Ah, me!"

                           Yet all the sense
                           Of eloquence
                      Lies hidden in a maid's "Ah, me!"

       [PHOEBE weeps

       [Enter WILFRED

  WILFRED   Mistress Meryll!

  PHOEBE    [looking up] Eh! Oh! it's you, is it? You may go
            away,if you like. Because I don't want you, you know.

  WILFRED   Haven't you anything to say to me?

  PHOEBE    Oh yes! Are the birds all caged? The wild beasts all
            littered down? All the locks, chains, bolts, and bars
            in good order? Is the Little Ease sufficiently
            comfortable? The racks, pincers, and thumbscrews all
            ready for work? Ugh! you brute!

  WILFRED   These allusions to my professional duties are in
            doubtful taste. I didn't become a head-jailer because
            I like head-jailing. I didn't become an assistant-
            tormentor because I like assistant-tormenting. We
            can't all be sorcerers, you know. [PHOEBE is annoyed]
            Ah! you brought that upon yourself.

  PHOEBE    Colonel Fairfax is not a sorcerer. He's a man of
            science and an alchemist.

  WILFRED   Well, whatever he is, he won't be one for long, for
            he's to be beheaded to-day for dealings with the
            devil. His master nearly had him last night, when the
            fire broke out in the Beauchamp [pronounced Bee'cham]
            Tower.

  PHOEBE    Oh! how I wish he had escaped in the confusion! But
            take care; there's still time for a reply to his
            petition for mercy.

  WILFRED   Ah! I'm content to chance that. This evening at half-
            past seven— ah! [Gesture of chopping off a head.]

  PHOEBE    You're a cruel monster to speak so unfeelingly of the
            death of a young and handsome soldier.

  WILFRED   Young and handsome! How do you know he's young and
            handsome?

  PHOEBE    Because I've seen him every day for weeks past taking
            his exercise on the Beauchamp [pronounced Bee'cham]
            Tower.

  WILFRED   Curse him!

  PHOEBE    There, I believe you're jealous of him, now. Jealous
            of a man I've never spoken to! Jealous of a poor soul
            who's to die in an hour!

  WILFRED   I am! I'm jealous of everybody and everything. I'm
            jealous of the very words I speak to you— because they
            reach your ears— and I mustn't go near 'em!

  PHOEBE    How unjust you are! Jealous of the words you speak to
            me! Why, you know as well as I do that I don't even
            like them.

  WILFRED   You used to like 'em.

  PHOEBE    I used to pretend I like them. It was mere politeness
            to comparative strangers.

            [Exit PHOEBE, with spinning wheel

  WILFRED   I don't believe you know what jealousy is! I don't
            believe you know how it eats into a man's heart— and
            disorders his digestion— and turns his interior into
            boiling lead. Oh, you are a heartless jade to trifle
            with the delicate organization of the human interior.

                  <h5> No. 1A. When jealous torments
                          (OPTIONAL SONG)
                              Wilfred
                  </h5>

  WILFRED        When jealous torments rack my soul,
                      My agonies I can't control,
                 Oh, better sit on red hot coal
                      Than love a heartless jade.

                 The red hot coal will hurt no doubt,
                      But red hot coals in time die out,
                 But jealousy you can not rout,
                      Its fires will never fade.

                 It's much less painful on the whole
                      To go and sit on red hot coal
                 'Til you're completely flayed,
                 Or ask a kindly friend to crack
                      Your wretched bones upon the rack
                 Than love a heartless jade,
                      Than love a heartless jade.

                 The kerchief on your neck of snow
                      I look on as a deadly foe,
                 It goeth where I dare not go
                      And stops there all day long.

                 The belt that holds you in its grasp
                      Is to my peace of mind a rasp,
                 It claspeth what I can not clasp,
                      Correct me if I'm wrong.

                 It's much less painful on the whole
                      To go and sit on red hot coal
                 'Til you're completely flayed,
                 Or ask a kindly friend to crack
                      Your wretched bones upon the rack
                 Than love a heartless jade,
                      Than love a heartless jade.

                 The bird that breakfasts on your lip,
                      I would I had him in my grip,
                 He sippeth where I dare not sip,
                      I can't get over that.

                 The cat you fondle soft and sly,
                      He layeth where I dare not lie.
                 We're not on terms, that cat and I.
                      I do not like that cat.

                 It's much less painful on the whole
                      To go and sit on red hot coal
                 'Til you're completely flayed,
                 Or ask a kindly friend to crack
                      Your wretched bones upon the rack
                 Than love a heartless jade,
                      Than love a heartless jade.

                 Or ask a kindly friend to crack
                      Your wretched bones upon the rack

  DAME      A good day to you!

  2ND
    YEOMAN  Good day, Dame Carruthers. Busy to-day?

  DAME      Busy, aye! the fire in the Beauchamp [pronounced
            Bee'cham] last night has given me work enough. A dozen
            poor prisoners— Richard Colfax, Sir Martin Byfleet,
            Colonel Fairfax, Warren the preacher-poet, and half-a-
            score others— all packed into one small cell, not six
            feet square. Poor Colonel Fairfax, who's to die to-
            day, is to be removed to no. 14 in the Cold Harbour
            that he may have his last hour alone with his
            confessor; and I've to see to that.

  2ND
    YEOMAN  Poor gentleman! He'll die bravely. I fought under him
            two years since, and he valued his life as it were a
            feather!

  PHOEBE    He's the bravest, the handsomest, and the best young
            gentleman in England! He twice saved my father's life;
            and it's a cruel thing, a wicked thing, and a
            barbarous thing that so gallant a hero should lose his
            head— for it's the handsomest head in England!

  DAME      For dealings with the devil. Aye! if all were beheaded
            who dealt with him, there'd be busy things on Tower
            Green.

  PHOEBE    You know very well that Colonel Fairfax is a student
            of alchemy— nothing more, and nothing less; but this
            wicked Tower, like a cruel giant in a fairy-tale, must
            be fed with blood, and that blood must be the best and
            bravest in England, or it's not good enough for the
            old Blunderbore. Ugh!

  DAME      Silence, you silly girl; you know not what you say. I
            was born in the old keep, and I've grown grey in it,
            and, please God, I shall die and be buried in it; and
            there's not a stone in its walls that is not as dear
            tome as my right hand.

                     Dame Carruthers and Yeomen

  DAME      When our gallant Norman foes
                 Made our merry land their own,
                 And the Saxons from the Conqueror were flying,

            At his bidding it arose,
                 In its panoply of stone,
                      A sentinel unliving and undying.

            Insensible, I trow,
                 As a sentinel should be,
                 Though a queen to save her head should
                      come a-suing,
            There's a legend on its brow
                 That is eloquent to me,
                 And it tells of duty done and duty doing.

            The screw may twist and the rack may turn,
            And men may bleed and men may burn,
            O'er London town and its golden hoard
            I keep my silent watch and ward!

  CHORUS    The screw may twist and the rack may turn,
            O'er London town and all its hoard,
            And men may bleed and men may burn,
            O'er London town and all its hoard,
            O'er London town and its golden hoard
            I keep my silent watch and ward!

  DAME      Within its wall of rock
            The flower of the brave
                 Have perished with a constancy unshaken.
            From the dungeon to the block,
                 From the scaffold to the grave,
                 Is a journey many gallant hearts have taken.

            And the wicked flames may hiss
                 Round the heroes who have fought
                 For conscience and for home in all its beauty,
            But the grim old fortalice
                 Takes little heed of aught
                      That comes not in the measure of its duty.

            The screw may twist and the rack may turn,
            And men may bleed and men may burn,
            O'er London town and its golden hoard
            I keep my silent watch and ward!

       [Exeunt all but PHOEBE. Enter SERGEANT MERYLL.

  PHOEBE    Father! Has no reprieve arrived for the poor
            gentleman?

  MERYLL    No, my lass; but there's one hope yet. Thy brother
            Leonard, who, as a reward for his valour in saving his
            standard and cutting his way through fifty foes who
            would have hanged him, has been appointed a Yeoman of
            the Guard, will arrive to-day; and as he comes
            straight from Windsor, where the Court is, it may be—
            it may be— that he will bring the expected reprieve
            with him.

  PHOEBE    Oh, that he may!

  MERYLL    Amen to that! For the Colonel twice saved my life, and
            I'd give the rest of my life to save his! And wilt
            thou not be glad to welcome thy brave brother, with
            the fame of whose exploits all England is a-ringing?

  PHOEBE    Aye, truly, if he brings the reprieve.

  MERYLL    And not otherwise?

  PHOEBE    Well, he's a brave fellow indeed, and I love brave
            men.

  MERYLL    All brave men?

  PHOEBE    Most of them, I verily believe! But I hope Leonard
            will not be too strict with me— they say he is a very

            father is kindness itself, and——

  MERYLL    And leaves thee pretty well to thine own ways, eh?
            Well, I've no fears for thee; thou hast a feather-
            brain, but thou'rt a good lass.

  PHOEBE    Yes, that's all very well, but if Leonard is going to
            tell me that I may not do this and I may not do that,
            and I must not talk to this one, or walk with that
            one, but go through the world with my lips pursed up
            and my eyes cats down, like a poor nun who has
            renounced mankind— why, as I have not renounced
            mankind, and don't mean to renounce mankind, I won't
            have it— there!
  MERYLL    Nay, he'll not check thee more than is good for thee,
            Phoebe! He's a brave fellow, and bravest among brave
            fellows, and yet it seems but yesterday that he robbed
            the Lieutenant's orchard.

  MERYLL         A laughing boy but yesterday,
                      A merry urchin blithe and gay,
                 Whose joyous shout came ringing out
                      Unchecked by care or sorrow.

                 Today a warrior all sunbrown,
                      When deeds of soldierly renown
                 Are not the boast of London town,
                      A veteran tomorrow, today a warrior,
                      A veteran tomorrow!

                      A soldier's pulse beats double time,
                 And grave hearts thrill as brave hearts will
                      At tales of martial glory.

                 I burn with flush of pride and joy,
                      A pride unbittered by alloy,
                 To find my boy, my darling boy,

  LEONARD   Father!

  MERYLL    Leonard! my brave boy! I'm right glad to see thee, and
            so is Phoebe!

  PHOEBE    Aye— hast thou brought Colonel Fairfax's reprieve?

  LEONARD   Nay, I have here a despatch for the Lieutenant, but no
            reprieve for the Colonel!

  PHOEBE    Poor gentleman! poor gentleman!

  LEONARD   Aye, I would I had brought better news. I'd give my
            right hand— nay, my body— my life, to save his!

  MERYLL    Dost thou speak in earnest, my lad?

  LEONARD   Aye, father— I'm no braggart. Did he not save thy
            life? and am I not his foster-brother?

  MERYLL    Then hearken to me. Thou hast come to join the Yeomen
            of the Guard!

  LEONARD   Well?

  MERYLL    None has seen thee but ourselves?

  LEONARD   And a sentry, who took scant notice of me.

  MERYLL    Now to prove thy words. Give me the despatch and get
            thee hence at once! Here is money, and I'll send thee
            more. Lie hidden for a space, and let no one know.
            I'll convey a suit of Yeoman's uniform to the
            Colonel's cell— he shall shave off his beard, so that
            none shall know him, and I'll own him as my son, the
            brave Leonard Meryll, who saved his flag and cut his
            way through fifty foes who thirsted for his life. He
            will be welcomed without question by my brother-
            Yeomen, I'll warrant that. Now, how to get access to
            the Colonel's cell? [To PHOEBE] The key is with they
            sour-faced admirer, Wilfred Shadbolt.

  PHOEBE    [demurely] I think— I say, I think— I can get anything
            I want from Wilfred. I think— mind I say, I think— you
            may leave that to me.

  MERYLL    Then get thee hence at once, lad— and bless thee for
            this sacrifice.

  PHOEBE    And take my blessing, too, dear, dear Leonard!

  LEONARD   And thine. eh? Humph! Thy love is newborn; wrap it up
            carefully, lest it take cold and die.

       meeting him.

  LIEUT.    Halt! Colonel Fairfax, my old friend, we meet but
            sadly.

  FAIRFAX   Sir, I greet you with all good-will; and I thank you
            for the zealous acre with which you have guarded me
            from the pestilent dangers which threaten  human life
            outside. In this happy little community, Death, when
            he comes, doth so in punctual and business-like
            fashion; and, like a courtly gentleman, giveth due
            notice of his advent, that one may not be taken
            unawares.

  LIEUT.    Sir, you bear this bravely, as a brave man should.

  FAIRFAX   Why, sir, it is no light boon to die swiftly and
            surely at a given hour and in a given fashion! Truth
            to tell, I would gladly have my life; but if that may
            not be, I have the next best thing to it, which is
            death. Believe me, sir, my lot is not so much amiss!

  PHOEBE    [aside to MERYLL] Oh, father, father, I cannot bear
            it!

  MERYLL    My poor lass!

  FAIRFAX   Nay, pretty one, why weepest thou? Come, be comforted.
            Such a life as mine is not worth weeping for. [sees
            MERYLL] Sergeant Meryll, is it not? [to LIEUTENANT]
            May I greet my old friend? [Shakes MERYLL's hand;
            MERYLL begins to weep] Why, man, what's all this? Thou
            and I have faced the grim old king a dozen times, and
            never has his majesty come to me in such goodly
            fashion. Keep a stout heart, good fellow— we are
            soldiers, and we know how to die, thou and I. Take my
            word for it, it is easier to die well than to live
            well— for, in sooth, I have tried both.

       [At the end, PHOEBE is led off, weeping, by MERYLL.

  FAIRFAX   And now, Sir Richard, I have a boon to beg. I am in
            this strait for no better reason than because my
            kinsman, Sir Clarence Poltwhistle, one of the
            Secretaries of State, has charged me with sorcery, in
            order that he may succeed in my estate, which devolves
            to him provided I die unmarried.

  LIEUT.    As thou wilt most surely do.

  FAIRFAX   Nay, as I will most surely not do, by your worship's
            grace! I have a mind to thwart this good cousin of
            mine.

  LIEUT.    How?

  FAIRFAX   By marrying forthwith, to be sure!

  LIEUT.    But heaven ha' mercy, whom wouldst thou marry?

  FAIRFAX   Nay, I am indifferent on that score. Coming Death hath
            made of me a true and chivalrous knight, who holds all
            womankind in such esteem that the oldest, and the
            meanest, and the worst-favoured of them is good enough
            for him. So, my good Lieutenant, if thou wouldst serve
            a poor soldier who has but an hour to live, find me
            the first that comes— my confessor shall marry us, and
            her dower shall be my dishonoured name and a hundred
            crowns to boot. No such poor dower for an hour of
            matrimony!

  LIEUT.    A strange request. I doubt that I should be warranted
            in granting it.

  FAIRFAX   There never was a marriage fraught with so little of
            evil to the contracting parties. In an hour she'll be
            a widow, and I— a bachelor again for aught I know!

  LIEUT.    Well, I will see what can be done, for I hold thy
            kinsman in abhorrence for the scurvy trick he has
            played thee.

  FAIRFAX   A thousand thanks, good sir; we meet again in this
            spot in an hour or so. I shall be a bridegroom then,
            and your worship will wish me joy. Till then,
            farewell. [To GUARD] I am ready, good fellows.

       [Exit with GUARD into Cold Harbour Tower]

  LIEUT.    He is a brave fellow, and it is a pity that he should
            die. Now, how to find him a bride at such short
            notice? Well, the task should be easy! [Exit]

            taking off of hands, and herein is contradiction

  POINT                    It is sung to the knell
                      Of a churchyard bell,
            And a doleful dirge, ding dong, O!
            It's a song of a popinjay, bravely born,
            Who turned up his noble nose with scorn
            At the humble merrymaid, peerly proud,
            Who loved a lord, and who laughed aloud
            At the moan of the merryman, moping mum,
            Whose soul was sad, and whose glance was glum,
            Who sipped no sup, and who craved no crumb,
                 As he sighed for the love of a ladye!
                      Heighdy! heighdy!
                      Misery me—lack-a-day-dee!
            He sipped no sup, and he craved no crumb,
            As he sighed for the love of a ladye!

  ELSIE               I have a song to sing, O!

  POINT               Sing me your song, O!

  ELSIE               It is sung with a sigh
                 And a tear in the eye,
            For it tells of a righted wrong, O!
            It's a song of the merrymaid, once so gay,
            Who turned on her heel and tripped away
            From the peacock popinjay, bravely born,
            Who turned up his noble nose with scorn
            At the humble heart that he did not prize:
            So she begged on her knees, with downcast eyes,
            For the love of the merryman, moping mum,
            Whose soul was sad, and whose glance was glum,
            Who sipped no sup, and who craved no crumb,
                 As he sighed for the love of a ladye!

  BOTH           Heighdy! heighdy!
                 Misery me—lack-a-day-dee!
            His pains were o'er, and he sighed no more,
            For he lived in the love of a ladye!

                 Heighdy! heighdy!
                 Misery me—lack-a-day-dee!
            His pains were o'er, and he sighed no more,
            For he lived in the love of a ladye!

  2ND
   CITIZEN  A kiss for that, pretty maid!

  ALL       Aye, a kiss all round. [CROWD gathers around her]

  ELSIE     [drawing dagger] Best beware! I am armed!

  POINT     Back, sirs— back! This is going too far.

  2ND
   CITIZEN  Thou dost not see the humour of it, eh? Yet there is
            humour in all things— even in this. [Trying to kiss
            her]

  ELSIE     Help! Help!

       [Enter LIEUTENANT with GUARD. CROWD falls back

  LIEUT.    What is the pother?

  ELSIE     Sir, we sang to these folk, and they would have repaid
            us with gross courtesy, but for your honour's coming.

  LIEUT.    [to CROWD] Away with ye! Clear the rabble.

            [GUARDS push CROWD off, and go off with them]

            Now, my girl, who are you, and what do you here?

  ELSIE     May it please you, sir, we are two strolling players,
            Jack Point and I, Elsie Maynard, at your worship's
            service. We go from fair to fair, singing, and
            dancing, and playing brief interludes; and so we make
            a poor living.

  LIEUT.    You two, eh? Are ye man and wife?

  POINT     No, sir; for though I'm a fool, there is a limit to my
            folly. Her mother, old Bridget Maynard, travels with
            us (for Elsie is a good girl), but the old woman is a-
            bed with fever, and we have come here to pick up some
            silver to buy an electuary for her.

  LIEUT.    Hark ye, my girl! Your mother is ill?

  ELSIE     Sorely ill, sir.

  LIEUT.    And needs good food, and many things that thou canst
            not buy?

  ELSIE     Alas! sir, it is too true.

  LIEUT.    Wouldst thou earn an hundred crowns?

  ELSIE     An hundred crowns! They might save her life!

  LIEUT.    Then listen! A worthy but unhappy gentleman is to be
            beheaded in an hour on this very spot. For sufficient
            reasons, he desires to marry before he dies, and he
            hath asked me to find him a wife. Wilt thou be that
            wife?

  ELSIE     The wife of a man I have never seen!

  POINT     Why, sir, look you, I am concerned in this; for though
            I am not yet wedded to Elsie Maynard, time works
            wonders, and there's no knowing what may be in store
            for us. Have we your worship's word for it that this
            gentleman will die to-day?

  LIEUT.    Nothing is more certain, I grieve to say.

  POINT     And that the maiden will be allowed to depart the very
            instant the ceremony is at an end?

  LIEUT.    The very instant. I pledge my honour that it shall be
            so.

  POINT     An hundred crowns?

  LIEUT.    An hundred crowns!

  POINT     For my part, I consent. It is for Elsie to speak.

  ELSIE               A strange proposal you reveal,
                 It almost makes my senses reel.
                 Alas! I'm very poor indeed,
                 And such a sum I sorely need.
                      My mother, sir, is like to die.
                           This money life may bring.

                      Within the hour is duly laid,
                           Objection I will waive!
                           Yes, objection I will waive!

  LIEUT.    And so, good fellow, you are a jester?

  POINT     Aye, sir, and like some of my jests, out of place.

  LIEUT.    I have a vacancy for such an one. Tell me, what are
            your qualifications for such a post?

            sardonic, one by one, or all at once; I have a pretty
            turn for anecdote; I know all the jests— ancient and
            modern— past, present, and to come; I can riddle you
            from dawn of day to set of sun, and, if that content
            you not, well on to midnight and the small hours. Oh,

                      At peer or prince— at prince or peer,
                      I aim my shaft and know no fear!

                 I can set a braggart quailing with a quip,

                      Should always gild the philosophic pill!

  LIEUT.    And how came you to leave your last employ?

  POINT     Why, sir, it was in this wise. My Lord was the
            Archbishop of Canterbury, and it was considered that
            one of my jokes was unsuited to His Grace's family
            circle. In truth, I ventured to ask a poor riddle,
            sir— Wherein lay the difference between His Grace and
            poor Jack Point? His Grace was pleased to give it up,
            sir. And thereupon I told him that whereas His Grace
            was paid 10,000 a year for being good, poor Jack Point
            was good— for nothing. 'Twas but a harmless jest, but
            it offended His Grace, who whipped me and set me in
            the stocks for a scurril rogue, and so we parted. I
            had as lief not take post again with the dignified
            clergy.

  LIEUT.    But I trust you are very careful not to give offence.
            I have daughters.

  POINT     Sir, my jests are most carefully selected, and
            anything objectionable is expunged. If your honour
            pleases, I will try then first on your honour's
            chaplain.

  LIEUT.    Can you give me an example? Say that I had sat me down
            hurriedly on something sharp?

  POINT     Sir, I should say that you had sat down on the spur of
            the moment.

  LIEUT.    Humph! I don't think much of that. Is that the best
            you can do?

  POINT     It has always been much admired, sir, but we will try
            again.

  LIEUT.    Well, then, I am at dinner, and the joint of meat is
            but half cooked.

  POINT     Why then, sir, I should say that what is underdone
            cannot be helped.

  LIEUT.    I see. I think that manner of thing would be somewhat
            irritating.

  POINT     At first, sir, perhaps; but use is everything, and you
            would come in time to like it.

  LIEUT.    We will suppose that I caught you kissing the kitchen
            wench under my very nose.

  POINT     Under her very nose, good sir— not under yours! That
            is where I would kiss her. Do you take me? Oh, sir, a
            pretty wit— a pretty, pretty wit!

  LIEUT.    The maiden comes. Follow me, friend, and we will
            discuss this matter at length in my library.

  POINT     I am your worship's servant. That is to say, I trust
            I soon shall be. But, before proceeding to a more
            serious topic, can you tell me, sir, why a cook's
            brain-pan is like an overwound clock?

  LIEUT.    A truce to this fooling— follow me.

  POINT     Just my luck; my best conundrum wasted!

  PHOEBE    [aside] Now to get the keys from him.

            [Aloud] Wilfred— has no reprieve arrived?

  WILFRED   None. Thine adored Fairfax is to die.

  PHOEBE    Nay, thou knowest that I have naught but pity for the
            poor condemned gentleman.

  WILFRED   I know that he who is about to die is more to thee
            than I, who am alive and well.

  PHOEBE    Why, that were out of reason, dear Wilfred. Do they
            not say that a live ass is better than a dead lion?
            No, I didn't mean that!

  WILFRED   Oh, they say that, do they?

  PHOEBE    It's unpardonably rude of them, but I believe they put
            it in that way. Not that it applies to thee, who art
            clever beyond all telling!

  WILFRED   Oh yes, as an assistant-tormentor.

       and hands them to MERYLL, who enters the Tower, unnoticed
       by WILFRED.

  WILFRED   Truly, I have seen great resolution give way under my
            persuasive methods [working with a small thumbscrew].
            In the nice regulation of a thumbscrew— in the
            hundredth part of a single revolution lieth all the
            difference between stony reticence and a torrent of
            impulsive unbosoming that the pen can scarcely follow.
            Ha! ha! I am a mad wag.

  PHOEBE    [with a grimace] Thou art a most light-hearted and
            delightful companion, Master Wilfred. Thine anecdotes
            of the torture-chamber are the prettiest hearing.

  WILFRED   I'm a pleasant fellow an' I choose. I believe I am the
            merriest dog that barks. Ah, we might be passing happy
            together—

  PHOEBE    Perhaps. I do not know.

  WILFRED   For thou wouldst make a most tender and loving wife.

  PHOEBE    Aye, to one whom I really loved. For there is a wealth
            of love within this little heart— saving up for— I
            wonder whom? Now, of all the world of men, I wonder
            whom? To think that he whom I am to wed is now alive
            and somewhere! Perhaps far away, perhaps close at
            hand! And I know him not! It seemeth that I am wasting
            time in not knowing him.

  WILFRED   Now say that it is I— nay! suppose it for the nonce.
            Say that we are wed— suppose it only— say that thou
            art my very bride, and I thy cherry, joyous, bright,
            frolicsome husband— and that, the day's work being
            done, and the prisoners stored away for the night,
            thou and I are alone together— with a long, long
            evening before us!

  PHOEBE    [with a grimace] It is a pretty picture— but I
            scarcely know. It cometh so unexpectedly— and yet—and
            yet— were I thy bride—

  WILFRED   Aye!— wert thou my bride—?

  PHOEBE    Oh, how I would love thee!

                           Our happiness would dwell—

                      And all day long
                 Our lives should be a song:
                      No grief, no wrong
                           Should make my heart rebel—

                 The melancholy lute,

                           To my low-whispered coo—

            them at WILFRED's girdle, unnoticed by him. Exit

                      A feather's press
                 Were leaden heaviness to my caress.
                           But then, of course, you see,
                      I'm not thy bride.

       [Exit PHOEBE

  WILFRED   No, thou'rt not— not yet! But, Lord, how she woo'd; I
            should be no mean judge of wooing, seeing that I have
            been more hotly woo'd than most men. I have been woo'd
            by maid, widow, and wife. I have been woo'd boldly,
            timidly, tearfully, shyly— by direct assault, by
            suggestion, by implication, by inference, and by
            innuendo. But this wooing is not of the common order;
            it is the wooing of one who must needs me, if she die
            for it!

       Tower.

  MERYLL    [looking after them] The deed is, so far, safely
            accomplished. The slyboots, how she wheedled him! What
            a helpless ninny is a love-sick man! He is but as a
            lute in a woman's hands— she plays upon him whatever
            tune she will. But the Colonel comes. I' faith, he's
            just in time, for the Yeomen parade here for his
            execution in two minutes!

       Yeoman's uniform.

            me!

  MERYLL    Tut, sir, no risk. I'll warrant none here will
            recognise you. You make a brave Yeoman, sir! So— this
            ruff is too high; so— and the sword should hang thus.
            Here is your halbert, sir; carry it thus. The Yeomen
            come. Now, remember, you are my brave son, Leonard
            Meryll.

                 Of all immured within these walls,
                      To-day the very worthiest falls!

  ALL            Oh, Mercy, thou whose smile has shone
                      So many a captive heart upon;
                 Of all immured within these walls,
                      The very worthiest falls.
                           Oh, Mercy, Oh, Mercy!

       [Enter FAIRFAX and TWO YEOMEN from Tower in great
       excitement.

  FAIRFAX             My lord! I know not how to tell
                      The news I bear!
                 I and my comrades sought the pris'ner's cell—
                      He is not there!

  ALL                 He is not there!
                 They sought the pris'ner's cell—
                           he is not there!

  FAIRFAX AND
    TWO YEOMEN        As escort for the prisoner
                      We sought his cell, in duty bound;
                 The double gratings open were,
                      No prisoner at all we found!

                 We hunted high, we hunted low,
                      We hunted here, we hunted there—
                 The man we sought with anxious care
                      Had vanished into empty air!
                 The man we sought with anxious care
                      Had vanished into empty air!

       [Exit LIEUTENANT

  WOMEN               Now, by my troth, the news is fair,
                 The man has vanished into air!

  ALL            As escort for the prisoner
                      We/they sought his cell in duty bound;
                 The double gratings open were,
                      No prisoner at all we/they found,
                 We/they hunted high, we/they hunted low,
                      We/they hunted here, we/they hunted there,
                 The man we/they sought with anxious care
                      Had vanished into empty air!
                 The man we/they sought with anxious care
                      Had vanished into empty air!

       [Enter WILFRED, followed by LIEUTENANT

  LIEUT.              Astounding news! The pris'ner fled!
                 [To WILFRED] Thy life shall forfeit be instead!

       [WILFRED is arrested

  WILFRED             My lord, I did not set him free,
                 I hate the man— my rival he!

  MERYLL              The pris'ner gone— I'm all agape!

  LIEUT.              Thy life shall forfeit be instead!

  MERYLL              Who could have helped him to escape?

  WILFRED             My lord, I did not set him free!

  PHOEBE              Indeed I can't imagine who!
                 I've no idea at all, have you?

       [Enter JACK POINT

  DAME           Of his escape no traces lurk,
                 Enchantment must have been at work!

  ELSIE               [aside to POINT]
                 What have I done? Oh, woe is me!

  PHOEBE & DAME       Indeed I can't imagine who!
                 I've no idea at all, have you?

  ELSIE               I am his wife, and he is free!

  POINT               Oh, woe is you? Your anguish sink!
                 Oh, woe is me, I rather think!
                 Oh, woe is me, I rather think!
                 Yes, woe is me, I rather think!
                      Whate'er betide
                      You are his bride,
                      And I am left
                      Alone— bereft!
                 Yes, woe is me, I rather think!
                 Yes, woe is me, I rather think!
                 Yes, woe is me, Yes, woe is me, Yes, woe is me,
                 Yes, woe is me, I rather think!

  ENSEMBLE            All frenzied with despair I/they rave,
                      The grave is cheated of its due.
                 Who is, who is the misbegotten knave
                      Who hath contrived this deed to do?

                 Let search, let search
                      Be made throughout the land,
                      Or his/my vindictive anger dread—
                 A thousand marks, a thousand marks
                           he'll/I'll hand
                      Who brings him here, alive or dead,
                      Who brings him here, alive or dead!
                 A thousand marks, a thousand marks,
                      Alive, alive or dead
                      Alive, alive or dead
                 Who brings him here, alive, alive, or dead.

       [At the end, ELSIE faints in FAIRFAX's arms; all the YEOMEN
       and CROWD rush off the stage in different directions, to
       hunt for the fugitive, leaving only the HEADSMAN on the
       stage, and ELSIE insensible in FAIRFAX's arms.
