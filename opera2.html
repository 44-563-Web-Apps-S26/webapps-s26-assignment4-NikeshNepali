           <p class="direction">[Exit ELSIE as WILFRED re-enters.</p>

  <h6 class="name wilfred">WILFRED</h6>   <p class="direction">[looking after ELSIE] </p>'Tis an odd freak for a dying
            man and his confessor to be closeted alone with a
            strange singing girl. I would fain have espied them,
            but they stopped up the keyhole. My keyhole!

       <p class="direction">[Enter PHOEBE with SERGEANT MERYLL. MERYLL remains in the
       background, unobserved by WILFRED.</p>

  <h6 class="name phoebe">PHOEBE</h6>    [aside] Wilfred— and alone!

  <h6 class="name wilfred">WILFRED</h6>   Now what could he have wanted with her? That's what
            puzzles me!

  <h6 class="name phoebe">PHOEBE</h6>    [aside] Now to get the keys from him.

            [Aloud] Wilfred— has no reprieve arrived?

  <h6 class="name wilfred">WILFRED</h6>   None. Thine adored Fairfax is to die.

  <h6 class="name phoebe">PHOEBE</h6>    Nay, thou knowest that I have naught but pity for the
            poor condemned gentleman.

  <h6 class="name wilfred">WILFRED</h6>   I know that he who is about to die is more to thee
            than I, who am alive and well.

  <h6 class="name phoebe">PHOEBE</h6>    Why, that were out of reason, dear Wilfred. Do they
            not say that a live ass is better than a dead lion?
            No, I didn't mean that!

  <h6 class="name wilfred">WILFRED</h6>   Oh, they say that, do they?

  <h6 class="name phoebe">PHOEBE</h6>    It's unpardonably rude of them, but I believe they put
            it in that way. Not that it applies to thee, who art
            clever beyond all telling!

  <h6 class="name wilfred">WILFRED</h6>   Oh yes, as an assistant-tormentor.

  <h6 class="name phoebe">PHOEBE</h6>    Nay, as a wit, as a humorist, as a most philosophic
            commentator on the vanity of human resolution.

       <p class="direction">[PHOEBE slyly takes bunch of keys from WILFRED's waistband
       and hands them to MERYLL, who enters the Tower, unnoticed
       by WILFRED.</p>

  <h6 class="name wilfred">WILFRED</h6>   <p class="speech">Truly, I have seen great resolution give way under my
            persuasive methods [working with a small thumbscrew].
            In the nice regulation of a thumbscrew— in the
            hundredth part of a single revolution lieth all the
            difference between stony reticence and a torrent of
            impulsive unbosoming that the pen can scarcely follow.
            Ha! ha! I am a mad wag.</p>

  <h6 class="name phoebe">PHOEBE</h6>    [with a grimace] Thou art a most light-hearted and
            delightful companion, Master Wilfred. Thine anecdotes
            of the torture-chamber are the prettiest hearing.

  <h6 class="name wilfred">WILFRED</h6>   I'm a pleasant fellow an' I choose. I believe I am the
            merriest dog that barks. Ah, we might be passing happy
            together—

  <h6 class="name phoebe">PHOEBE</h6>    Perhaps. I do not know.

  <h6 class="name wilfred">WILFRED</h6>   For thou wouldst make a most tender and loving wife.

  <h6 class="name phoebe">PHOEBE</h6>    Aye, to one whom I really loved. For there is a wealth
            of love within this little heart— saving up for— I
            wonder whom? Now, of all the world of men, I wonder
            whom? To think that he whom I am to wed is now alive
            and somewhere! Perhaps far away, perhaps close at
            hand! And I know him not! It seemeth that I am wasting
            time in not knowing him.

  <h6 class="name wilfred">WILFRED</h6>   Now say that it is I— nay! suppose it for the nonce.
            Say that we are wed— suppose it only— say that thou
            art my very bride, and I thy cherry, joyous, bright,
            frolicsome husband— and that, the day's work being
            done, and the prisoners stored away for the night,
            thou and I are alone together— with a long, long
            evening before us!

  <h6 class="name phoebe">PHOEBE</h6>    [with a grimace] It is a pretty picture— but I
            scarcely know. It cometh so unexpectedly— and yet—and
            yet— were I thy bride—

  <h6 class="name wilfred">WILFRED</h6>   Aye!— wert thou my bride—?

  <h6 class="name phoebe">PHOEBE</h6>    Oh, how I would love thee!
                      No. 11. Were I thy bride
                               (SONG)
                               Phoebe

  <h6 class="name phoebe">PHOEBE</h6>                  <p class="song"> Were I thy bride,
                 Then all the world beside
                      Were not too wide
                           To hold my wealth of love—
                      Were I thy bride!

                      Upon thy breast
                 My loving head would rest,
                      As on her nest
                           The tender turtle dove—
                      Were I thy bride!

                      This heart of mine
                 Would be one heart with thine,
                      And in that shrine
                           Our happiness would dwell—
                      Were I thy bride!

                      And all day long
                 Our lives should be a song:
                      No grief, no wrong
                           Should make my heart rebel—
                      Were I thy bride!

                      The silvery flute,
                 The melancholy lute,
                      Were night-owl's hoot
                           To my low-whispered coo—
                      Were I thy bride!

                      The skylark's trill
                 Were but discordance shrill
                      To the soft thrill
                           Of wooing as I'd woo—
                      Were I thy bride!

            [MERYLL re-enters; gives keys to PHOEBE, who replaces
            them at WILFRED's girdle, unnoticed by him. Exit
            MERYLL.

                      The rose's sigh
                 Were as a carrion's cry
                      To lullaby
                           Such as I'd sing to thee,
                      Were I thy bride!

                      A feather's press
                 Were leaden heaviness to my caress.
                           But then, of course, you see,
                      I'm not thy bride.
                      </p>

       [Exit PHOEBE

  <h6 class="name wilfred">WILFRED</h6>   <p class="speech">No, thou'rt not— not yet! But, Lord, how she woo'd; I
            should be no mean judge of wooing, seeing that I have
            been more hotly woo'd than most men. I have been woo'd
            by maid, widow, and wife. I have been woo'd boldly,
            timidly, tearfully, shyly— by direct assault, by
            suggestion, by implication, by inference, and by
            innuendo. But this wooing is not of the common order;
            it is the wooing of one who must needs me, if she die
            for it!
